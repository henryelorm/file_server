This is a simple service app that establishes a local http service to access directories that you want to share.


---------------------------------------

1.Change "hostip" in the "serve.py" located in the "Server" folder to your network IP address (ipconfig) in order to serve over local wireless network.

2.customize the served directory.
U can basically change the serving folder by re-assigning "rel_dir" to the customized path

run command "python serve.py" to start server.
